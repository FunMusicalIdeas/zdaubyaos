# zdaubyaos glossary

## styles

yaos: rhythmic; inherited from oumaotcou'aoiest
zdaub: melodic; inherited from stepwise

Each of these styles has its own Blocks and Renderings which create Contours mostly of length either 15 or 24. 

## compositional levels

Blocks: just raw patterns of numbers; each number is a Block
Contours: what you get after you map a Rendering onto some Blocks; each ContourElement represents a pitch (index) plus a duration
Note: what you get when you hydrate a ContourElement w/ gain & sustain information, readying it to be played

Notes: a sequence of Note; the smallest compositional object of the song, too small to write the song in directly
Parts: a sequence of Notes; a large enough compositional object to write the song in directly

Segment: a set of Parts of the same length to be played simultaneously by different Entities
