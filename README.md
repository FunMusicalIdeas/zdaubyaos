# zdaubyaos glossary


## element a: yaos

a rhythmic element
inherited from oumaotcou'aoiest

### blocks

#### 15

umow: 3,3,3,3,3
chuwow: 3,4,3,5
iest: 5,5,5

inai: 4,4,4,3
djiyai: 3,5,7
ouzd: 8,7

#### of 24

umow: 4,4,4,4,4,4
chuwow: 3,4,5,3,5,4
iest: 6,6,6,6

inai: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
djiyai: 3,3,5,3,3,7
ouzd: 8,8,8

### renderings

spring: 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8...
summer: 1,0,3,0,5,0,7,0...
fall: 3 => 1,2; 4 => 1,3; 5 => 1,4; 6 => 1,5 ... 


## element b: zdaub

a melodic element
proceeds mostly with notes shifting by 1 in both pitch and duration (inherited from stepwise)

### blocks

noodling: hovering around the bottom, fitting into either 15 or 24
escape/inscape: from ascent/descent
ascent/descent: going outward as far as it can go, still trying to fit into 15 or 24 as it does

### renderings

glis: each note has the same duration as its pitch
trem: each one of these notes is broken down into pieces of duration 1
bony: each one of these notes is broken down into pieces whis durations fit a backbone


## element c: backbones

interject some weird stuff now and then

### blocks

backboneFifteenA: 3,3,3,3,3
backboneFifteenB: 5,5,5
backboneFifteenC: 15

backboneTwentyfourA: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2
backboneTwentyfourB: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
backboneTwentyfourC: 4,4,4,4,4,4
backboneTwentyfourD: 6,6,6,6
backboneTwentyfourE: 8,8,8
backboneTwentyfourF: 12,12
backboneTwentyfourG: 24

### renderings

3 => 1,2; 5 => 2,3; 7 => 3,4 ...
4 => 1,3; 6 => 2,4; 8 => 3,5 ...


## compositional levels

blocks: just raw patterns of numbers
contours: what you get after you map renderings onto them
notes: are what you get when you map a note type onto a contour (renderings assume a note type, but you can get weird compositional distortions by overriding it)

notes are the lowest compositional building blocks of the song, aside from individual notes
then once you have some notes you can assemble what is currently called a "part"
which is still for a single entity to play

put together a set of parts? that set is not sequential, but simultaneous, and you've got a "segment" (of the song)

## truepart

a part which lasts 8x 15 + 4x 24 

and where the three entities are each either a yaos or a zdaub

### breather

a part which lasts 0x 15 + 1x 24

brief moments of respite between parts where only one entity is there, doing some simple version of what's coming to introduce it

### shiftypart

a part which lasts 8x 15 + 5x 24 

was originally kind of based on coagulating bits of backbones and it's kind of in-between a yaos and a zdaub

### backbonepart

a part which lasts 5x 15 + 6x 24 

and where the three entities are all backboning

### experimentpart

a part which lasts 0x 15 + 9x 24

### thirtyfivepart

a part which lasts 6x 35!!
