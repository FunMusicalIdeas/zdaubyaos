## element a: yaos

a rhythmic element
inherited from oumaotcou'aoiest

### breakdowns

umow: 3,3,3,3,3
chuwow: 3,4,3,5
iest: 5,5,5

inai: 3,4,4,4
djiyai: 3,5,7

### renderings

spring: 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8...
summer: 1,0,3,0,5,0,7,0...
fall: 3 => 1,2; 4 => 1,3; 5 => 1,4; 6 => 1,5 ... 


## element b: zdaub

a melodic element
proceeds mostly with notes shifting by 1 in both pitch and duration (inherited from stepwise)

### breakdowns

noodling: hovering around the bottom, fitting into either 15 or 24
escape/inscape: from ascent/descent
ascent/descent: going outward as far as it can go, still trying to fit into 15 or 24 as it does

### renderings

glis: each note has the same duration as its pitch
trem: each one of these notes is broken down into pieces of duration 1
bony: each one of these notes is broken down into pieces whis durations fit a backbone


## element c: backbones

interject some weird stuff now and then

### breakdowns

backboneFifteenA: 3,3,3,3,3
backboneFifteenB: 5,5,5
backboneFifteenC: 15

backboneTwentyfourA: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2
backboneTwentyfourB: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
backboneTwentyfourC: 4,4,4,4,4,4
backboneTwentyfourD: 6,6,6,6
backboneTwentyfourE: 8,8,8
backboneTwentyfourF: 12,12
backboneTwentyfourG: 24

### renderings

3 => 1,2; 5 => 2,3; 7 => 3,4 ...
4 => 1,3; 6 => 2,4; 8 => 3,5 ...


## compositional level: seasons

note that a "season" at the track level is still several of these pieces together...

## trueseason

a segment of the piece which lasts 8x 15 + 4x 24 

and where the three entities are each either a yaos or a zdaub

### backboneseason

lasts 5x 15 + 6x 24 

and where the three entities are all backboning

### breather

brief moments of respite between seasons where only one entity is there, doing some simple version of what's coming to introduce it

### shiftyseason

was originally kind of based on coagulating bits of backbones
i dunno this one is a mess right now: a weird season with an extra bar of 24 at the end
and it's kind of in-between a yaos and a zdaub
